# Stock Ticker System Evolution Timeline

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Basic Structure

### Milestone 1: Project Initialization

- Created new Rust project with `cargo new stock-ticker`
- Set up basic project structure with `src` directory
- Initialized Git repository with `.gitignore` for Rust projects

### Milestone 2: Core Dependencies Setup

- Added key dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:
  - `tokio` for async runtime
  - `async-nats` for message broker
  - `serde` and `serde_json` for serialization
  - `chrono` for timestamp handling
  - `rand` for random price generation
  - `axum` for HTTP API
  - `reqwest` for HTTP client
  - `sqlx` for database operations
  - `tracing` for logging

## Phase 2: Publisher Implementation

### Milestone 3: Stock Price Data Structure

- Created `StockPrice` struct with `symbol`, `price`, and `timestamp` fields
- Implemented serialization/deserialization with Serde
- Added `Clone` trait to support data sharing

### Milestone 4: Publisher Service

- Implemented publisher service in `src/bin/publisher.rs`
- Set up NATS connection and topic publishing
- Created random price generation logic
- Implemented continuous publishing loop with 2-second intervals

## Phase 3: Consumer Implementation

### Milestone 5: Consumer Service

- Implemented consumer service in `src/bin/consumer.rs`
- Set up NATS subscription to "stock_prices" topic
- Added message deserialization and display logic
- Implemented error handling for message processing

## Phase 4: Authentication Service

### Milestone 6: Auth Service Setup

- Created authentication service in `src/bin/auth_service.rs`
- Implemented `AppState` struct with thread-safe storage for authorized emails
- Set up Axum web server with routes for registration and authorization

### Milestone 7: Auth Service Endpoints

- Added `/register` endpoint for email registration
- Implemented `/is-authorized` endpoint for authorization checks
- Added `/list-emails` endpoint to view all authorized emails
- Integrated authorization checks with consumer and aggregator services

## Phase 5: Project Structure Refinement

### Milestone 8: Library Crate Implementation

- Created `src/lib.rs` to define the library crate
- Moved shared types to `src/types.rs`
- Updated import paths in all binaries to use the library crate

### Milestone 9: Binary Target Configuration

- Updated `Cargo.toml` to define binary targets:
  - `publisher` → `src/bin/publisher.rs`
  - `consumer` → `src/bin/consumer.rs`
  - `auth_service` → `src/bin/auth_service.rs`
  - `aggregator` → `src/bin/aggregator.rs`

## Phase 6: Aggregator Service Implementation

### Milestone 10: Aggregator Service

- Created aggregator service in `src/bin/aggregator.rs`
- Implemented `AggregatedStats` struct for statistical data
- Created `AggregatedState` struct for thread-safe state management
- Set up NATS subscription to collect stock price data
- Implemented statistical calculations for each stock symbol

### Milestone 11: Aggregator API Endpoints

- Added REST API endpoints:
  - `/aggregate` for all statistics
  - `/raw` for all raw data
  - `/aggregate/{symbol}` for symbol-specific statistics
  - `/raw/{symbol}` for symbol-specific raw data
- Integrated authorization checks with the auth service

## Phase 7: Documentation

### Milestone 12: README Creation

- Created comprehensive README.md with:
  - System architecture overview
  - Project structure explanation
  - Component descriptions
  - Running instructions
  - Future enhancement ideas

### Milestone 13: Component Documentation

- Created detailed documentation for each component:
  - `docs/publisher.md` for publisher service
  - `docs/consumer.md` for consumer service
  - `docs/auth_service.md` for authentication service
  - `docs/aggregator.md` for aggregator service

## Current State

The Stock Ticker System now consists of four main components:

1. **Publisher**: Generates and publishes simulated stock prices
2. **Consumer**: Subscribes to and displays stock price updates
3. **Authentication Service**: Manages user authorization
4. **Aggregator Service**: Collects, processes, and provides access to aggregated data

The system features:

- Centralized authorization through the auth service
- Real-time data distribution with NATS
- Statistical aggregation of stock prices
- REST API for data access
- Thread-safe state management
- Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

Future development will focus on:

1. Enhanced authentication with passwords and JWT tokens
2. Data persistence with database integration
3. User interface improvements for data visualization
4. Security enhancements for production deployment
5. Better error handling and recovery mechanisms
6. Advanced analytics and forecasting capabilities
